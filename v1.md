Embedding dashboards offers a lot of customization options to fit your security and UI needs. Some programming is required, but the process is quite straightforward. These steps should get you well on your way to providing valuable insights to your users.

## Step 0: Gather the Preset asset information

### How to Get Team ID
The easiest way to get your Team ID is to go to the Manage Team button on the Preset Homepage.  From here, you can gather the team name through the last part of the displayed URL:

### How to Get Workspace ID & Embedded Dashboard ID

Visit your dashboard. 

In the URL, the subdomain slug at the very beginning is your **Workspace ID**

Copy the ID shown to use as the resource id in the guest token API and to the front-end `embedDashboard` function.

**Note: Leaving the Allowed Domains field empty will allow embedding from any domain.**

## Step 1: (Back-end) Creating Guest Tokens

A Guest Token authenticates an end user to access an embedded dashboard. Guest tokens are created by calling the Manager endpoint `POST` `https://manage.app.preset.io/api/v1/teams/<TEAM NAME>/workspaces/<WORKSPACE NAME>/guest-token/` from your back-end service.

To make this request, you will first need to [authenticate with the Preset API](https://docs.preset.io/docs/using-the-preset-api) and get an access token. Access tokens have a short lifetime of a few hours, so in a long-running service, they’ll need to be refreshed periodically using your API Key.

> ⚠️ **Important!** Token creation must only be done in a trusted back-end execution context. Never expose your Preset API Key or your Preset Access Token!

A python example creating a Guest Token:

```python
  payload = {
	  "user": {
	    "username": "example_username",
	    "first_name": "First",
	    "last_name": "Last"
	  },
	  "resources": [{
	    "type": "dashboard",
	    "id": EMBEDDED_DASHBOARD_ID
	  }],
	  "rls": []
	}

	response = requests.post(
		"https://manage.app.preset.io/api/v1/teams/<TEAM NAME>/workspaces" +
		"/<WORKSPACE NAME>/guest-token/",
		data=payload,
		headers={ "Authorization": my_preset_access_token }
	).json()

  guest_token = response["data"]["payload"]["token"]
```

Explanation of the fields used in the `/guest-token` endpoint:

- `user` REQUIRED Profile info about the user viewing the dashboard. The `username` field should be unique for each user.
- `resources` REQUIRED  A list of the dashboards the user will be allowed to see (if you have multiple embedded dashboards, you can specify multiple here).
- `rls` REQUIRED  Specify a list of row-level security rules that will apply to the bearer of this token. [Row Level Security](https://superset.apache.org/docs/security/#row-level-security) applies additional `WHERE` clauses when querying a dataset for this user (such as when a chart is viewed). Some things to know:
    - A rule can have an optional `dataset: id` parameter if you only want it applied to a certain dataset.
    - Example clauses: `"publisher = 'Nintendo'"`, `"location_id = {warehouse.id}"`, `"NOT events.is_secret"` `team_id = {team_id}`
    - If you list multiple rules, they are joined in SQL using `AND`.
    - If you want to use `OR` or similar clause, it should be enclosed within the quotations
    - [Jinja templating](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/sql-templating/) can be used in the RLS clause for further customization.
    - ⚠️ Without a `dataset` parameter, a rule will be applied to all datasets. This is pretty convenient, but beware of introducing errors by referencing a column that does not exist in one of the datasets backing your dashboards!
    - ⚠️ Do not insert untrusted input into RLS clauses! (Such as information submitted to your app from a form, or from an external service). This would open up your analytics database to SQL injection attacks.

## Step 2: Supply Guest Tokens to your application front-end

The token created by the back-end will need to be passed to the front-end before your end user can view a dashboard.

You can perform this transfer in whatever way is appropriate for your application. The typical way is to expose an internal HTTP endpoint that authenticates your user, and creates and returns the guest token.

Here is an example  python/flask endpoint building on the example from before:

```python
@app.route("/guest-token", methods=["GET"])
@login_required
def get_guest_token():
  payload = {
	  "user": {
	    "username": g.user.username,
	    "first_name": g.user.first_name,
	    "last_name": g.user.last_name
	  },
	  "resources": [{
	    "type": "dashboard",
	    "id": EMBEDDED_DASHBOARD_ID
	  }],
	  "rls": [
	    { "clause": f"user_id = '{g.user.id}'" }
	  ]
	}

	token_response = requests.post(
		"https://manage.app.preset.io/api/v1/teams/<TEAM NAME>/workspaces" +
		"/<WORKSPACE NAME>/guest-token/",
		data=payload,
		headers={ "Authorization": preset_access_token }
	).json()

  return token_response["payload"]["token"]
```

### **This is the place to add access control code!**

Your code can decide which users should be granted guest tokens. You can also define row-level security rules in the `rls` parameter to dynamically determine the data that will be displayed to each user.

You will need to determine what the rules should be for your unique application, dashboard, and dataset, so that only the appropriate data will be displayed to your users.

The RLS rule defined above shows how you could filter dashboard data per-user based on their id. For another example, if your users belong to an organization and should only see their organization’s data, you might write an RLS rule like:

`{ "clause": "organization = {user.organization}" }`

## Step 3: (Front-end) Install the Superset Embedded SDK

**From NPM:**

`npm install --save @preset-sdk/embedded`

**From a CDN:**

You can load the SDK as a script in your HTML, if preferred. The SDK will be available as `presetSdk` globally:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@preset-sdk/embedded"></script>
```

## Step 4: Embed the dashboard using the SDK

When using ES6 imports or a build tool:

```jsx
import { embedDashboard } from "@preset-sdk/embedded";

embedDashboard({
  id: "6f03195d-0bf6-47a7-b44e-baa7636ac128", // given by the Superset embedding UI
  supersetDomain: "https://{WORKSPACE NAME}.us1a.app.preset.io",
  mountPoint: document.getElementById("my-superset-container"), // any html element that can contain an iframe
  fetchGuestToken: () => fetchGuestTokenFromBackend(),
  dashboardUiConfig: { hideTitle: true }, // dashboard UI config: hideTitle, hideTab, hideChartControls (optional)
});
```

Using a script tag with CDN:

```jsx

<script>
	presetSdk.embedDashboard({
	  id: "abc123", // given by the Superset embedding UI
	  supersetDomain: "https://{WORKSPACE NAME}.us1a.app.preset.io",
	  mountPoint: document.getElementById("my-superset-container"), // any html element that can contain an iframe
	  fetchGuestToken: () => fetchGuestTokenFromBackend(),
	  dashboardUiConfig: { hideTitle: true }, // dashboard UI config: hideTitle, hideTab, hideChartControls (optional)
	});
</script>
```

You may pass the following options to `embedDashboard`:

- `id` (required) An identifier of the embedded dashboard. Copy this from the “Embed Dashboard” screen in Superset, as seen here:
- `supersetDomain` (required) The domain where your Preset Workspace is located.
- `mountPoint` (required) Any HTML element that can contain an iframe.
- `fetchGuestToken` (required) An async function fetching a fresh guest token from the endpoint created in [Step 2](https://www.notion.so/Preset-Embedded-Customer-Developer-Documentation-c4ea062b60f1452daec23e8bbd650be0). This should return a new guest token each time it is called.
- `dashboardUiConfig` (optional) An object containing options to alter the dashboard UI. Possible options include:

```tsx
{
	hideTitle: boolean
	hideTab: boolean
	hideChartControls: boolean
}
```


## Security: Preparing your system for embedding

A strong system will have safeguards built in at multiple levels. With that in mind, it is important to take whatever protective steps you can, when using embedded dashboards to expose data outside your organization. The following precautionary measures are advised:

- Ensure that the database connections Preset uses to display your dashboards have the minimal necessary access. This could mean using a separate physical database, or a limited role, schema, or some other construction, depending on your data architecture.
- Use a separate Preset Workspace for embedded analytics than the ones you use for internal business analytics or other purposes.

## More on embedded authentication

A Preset Guest Token is what enables your users to access embedded Preset resources such as dashboards without having to log in to Preset normally. The Guest Token is used for all Workspace API calls made while viewing an embedded dashboard. It contains user profile data and all the permissions of the user.

Guest tokens have a short lifetime of 5 minutes, and need to be refreshed regularly. To accomplish this, the frontend SDK will call `fetchGuestToken` to get a new token.

Guest tokens have no ties to the Preset user who set up your embedded dashboard. The permissions your application assigns a guest token at creation are the full set of permissions that the end user will have.

Our design process is open source! For more details on the technical processes involved in embedded authentication, check out the [original embedded dashboard proposal on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/17187).
